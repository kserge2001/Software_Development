    print(f"Result: {result}")  # Executes if no exception
finally:
    print("This always executes")  # Cleanup code
```

#### File I/O Operations

Working with files is a fundamental skill for data processing:

```python
# Reading a text file
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)

# Writing to a file
with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write("Hello, world!\n")
    file.write("This is a test file.")

# Reading CSV data
import csv

with open('data.csv', 'r') as file:
    csv_reader = csv.reader(file)
    for row in csv_reader:
        print(row)

# Using pandas to read CSV (more common in ML)
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
print(df.head())
```

#### Object-Oriented Programming in Python

OOP is important for structuring complex ML projects:

```python
# Basic class definition
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        
    def greet(self):
        return f"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old."

# Creating objects
person1 = Person("Alice", 30)
person2 = Person("Bob", 25)

print(person1.greet())
print(person2.greet())

# Inheritance
class Student(Person):
    def __init__(self, name, age, student_id):
        super().__init__(name, age)  # Call parent constructor
        self.student_id = student_id
        
    def study(self, subject):
        return f"{self.name} is studying {subject}."

student = Student("Charlie", 22, "S12345")
print(student.greet())
print(student.study("Machine Learning"))
```

#### Functional Programming Elements

Functional programming techniques are widely used in data processing:

```python
# Lambda functions (anonymous functions)
square = lambda x: x**2
print(square(5))  # 25

# Map function
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared = list(map(lambda x: x**2, numbers))
print(squared)  # [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

# Filter function
even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))
print(even_numbers)  # [2, 4]

# List comprehensions as an alternative
squared_alt = [x**2 for x in numbers]
even_alt = [x for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0]

# Reduce function
from functools import reduce
sum_all = reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, numbers)
print(sum_all)  # 15
```

### Project: Text Analyzer

Let's create a more advanced project to practice our Python skills:

```python
def text_analyzer(text):
    """
    Analyze text and return statistics.
    
    Args:
        text (str): The text to analyze
        
    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing text statistics
    """
    # Check if input is valid
    if not isinstance(text, str):
        raise TypeError("Input must be a string")
    
    # Initialize statistics
    stats = {
        "char_count": 0,
        "word_count": 0,
        "sentence_count": 0,
        "most_common_words": [],
        "average_word_length": 0
    }
    
    # Character count (excluding spaces)
    stats["char_count"] = len(text.replace(" ", ""))
    
    # Word count
    words = text.lower().split()
    stats["word_count"] = len(words)
    
    # Sentence count (simplified)
    sentences = text.split(".")
    stats["sentence_count"] = len([s for s in sentences if s.strip()])
    
    # Most common words
    from collections import Counter
    word_counter = Counter(words)
    stats["most_common_words"] = word_counter.most_common(5)
    
    # Average word length
    if stats["word_count"] > 0:
        total_length = sum(len(word) for word in words)
        stats["average_word_length"] = total_length / stats["word_count"]
    
    return stats

# Example usage
sample_text = """
Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence and computer science 
which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans 
learn, gradually improving its accuracy. Machine learning is an important component 
of the growing field of data science.
"""

try:
    results = text_analyzer(sample_text)
    
    print("Text Analysis Results:")
    print(f"Character Count: {results['char_count']}")
    print(f"Word Count: {results['word_count']}")
    print(f"Sentence Count: {results['sentence_count']}")
    print(f"Average Word Length: {results['average_word_length']:.2f} characters")
    
    print("\nMost Common Words:")
    for word, count in results['most_common_words']:
        print(f"- '{word}': {count} occurrences")
        
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

## Data Manipulation and Analysis

In this section, we'll learn how to prepare, clean, transform, and analyze data - essential skills for machine learning.

### Data Acquisition

#### Loading Data from Various Sources

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# From CSV files
df_csv = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# From Excel files
df_excel = pd.read_excel('data.xlsx', sheet_name='Sheet1')

# From SQL databases
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///database.db')
df_sql = pd.read_sql("SELECT * FROM table_name", engine)

# From JSON
df_json = pd.read_json('data.json')

# From web (careful with scraping websites)
tables = pd.read_html('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population')

# From API
import requests
response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data')
data = response.json()
df_api = pd.json_normalize(data)
```

#### Creating Sample Data

```python
# Creating a DataFrame from scratch
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David', 'Emma'],
    'Age': [25, 30, 35, 40, 45],
    'City': ['New York', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago', 'Houston', 'Phoenix'],
    'Salary': [50000, 60000, 70000, 80000, 90000],
    'Department': ['HR', 'IT', 'Finance', 'Marketing', 'Sales']
})

# Creating a DataFrame with random data
np.random.seed(42)  # For reproducibility
df_random = pd.DataFrame({
    'A': np.random.randint(0, 100, size=10),
    'B': np.random.normal(0, 1, size=10),
    'C': np.random.choice(['X', 'Y', 'Z'], size=10),
    'D': pd.date_range(start='2023-01-01', periods=10)
})
```

### Exploring and Understanding Data

#### Basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

```python
# Display basic information
print(df.info())  # Summary of DataFrame
print(df.describe())  # Statistical summary of numeric columns
print(df.head())  # First 5 rows
print(df.tail())  # Last 5 rows
print(df.shape)  # (rows, columns)
print(df.columns)  # Column names
print(df.dtypes)  # Data types

# Check for missing values
print(df.isnull().sum())  # Count missing values by column

# Unique values in categorical columns
print(df['Department'].unique())
print(df['Department'].value_counts())

# Basic statistics by group
print(df.groupby('Department')['Salary'].mean())

# Correlation between numerical columns
print(df.corr())
```

#### Data Visualization for EDA

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Set up the style
sns.set(style="whitegrid")

# Distribution of a single variable
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.histplot(df['Salary'], kde=True)
plt.title('Salary Distribution')
plt.show()

# Box plot for numerical data
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.boxplot(x='Department', y='Salary', data=df)
plt.title('Salary by Department')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.show()

# Scatter
