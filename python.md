## Introduction to Python

### What is Python?

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has grown to become one of the most popular programming languages in the world.

### Key Features of Python

- **Easy to Learn and Read**: Clean syntax with emphasis on readability
- **Interpreted**: No compilation required
- **Dynamically Typed**: No need to declare variable types
- **High-level**: Abstracts complex details from the programmer
- **Versatile**: Suitable for web development, data science, AI, automation, and more
- **Cross-platform**: Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, and other systems
- **Extensive Standard Library**: "Batteries included" philosophy
- **Large Ecosystem**: Rich collection of third-party packages
- **Open Source**: Free to use and modify

### Python 2 vs Python 3

Python 3 was released in 2008 and introduced several incompatible changes with Python 2:

- **Unicode Strings**: All strings are Unicode in Python 3
- **Print Function**: `print "Hello"` in Python 2 vs `print("Hello")` in Python 3
- **Integer Division**: `3 / 2` equals `1` in Python 2 but `1.5` in Python 3
- **Iterators**: Many functions return iterators instead of lists in Python 3
- **Exception Handling**: Changes in syntax and behavior

> **Note**: Python 2 reached End of Life on January 1, 2020. All new projects should use Python 3.

### Python's Philosophy

Python's design philosophy is captured in the "Zen of Python," which can be viewed by typing `import this` in the Python interpreter:

```
Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
...
```

### Applications of Python

- **Web Development**: Django, Flask, FastAPI
- **Data Science and Analysis**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Machine Learning and AI**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn
- **Automation and Scripting**: System administration, task automation
- **Desktop GUI Applications**: Tkinter, PyQt, wxPython
- **Game Development**: Pygame
- **IoT and Hardware**: Raspberry Pi programming
- **Cybersecurity**: Penetration testing, forensics
- **Scientific Computing**: SciPy, Biopython

### Practice Exercise: Python Exploration

1. Research and list three significant projects or applications built with Python
2. Compare Python with another programming language you're familiar with
3. Explain why Python might be a good (or poor) choice for a specific type of application

## Setting Up the Python Environment

### Installing Python

#### Windows
1. Download the installer from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Run the installer, check "Add Python to PATH"
3. Click "Install Now"
4. Verify installation by opening Command Prompt and typing `python --version`

#### macOS
Python comes pre-installed on macOS, but it's usually an older version.

Using Homebrew (recommended):
```bash
# Install Homebrew if not already installed
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Install Python 3
brew install python
```

Verify installation: `python3 --version`

#### Linux
Most Linux distributions come with Python pre-installed.

For Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
```

For Fedora:
```bash
sudo dnf install python3 python3-pip
```

Verify installation: `python3 --version`

### Python Package Management

#### pip (Python Package Installer)

pip is the standard package manager for Python:

```bash
# Install a package
pip install package_name

# Install a specific version
pip install package_name==1.2.3

# Upgrade a package
pip install --upgrade package_name

# List installed packages
pip list

# Uninstall a package
pip uninstall package_name
```

#### Virtual Environments

Virtual environments allow you to create isolated Python environments for different projects:

```bash
# Install virtualenv (may not be needed with recent Python versions)
pip install virtualenv

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv myenv  # Or python3 -m venv myenv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
myenv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source myenv/bin/activate

# Deactivate the virtual environment
deactivate
```

Using `virtualenv` (alternative approach):
```bash
# Create virtual environment
virtualenv myenv

# Activate it
# On Windows:
myenv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source myenv/bin/activate
```

#### Anaconda/Miniconda

For data science and scientific computing:

1. Download and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
2. Create and manage environments:

```bash
# Create a new environment
conda create -n myenv python=3.9

# Activate environment
conda activate myenv

# Install packages
conda install numpy pandas matplotlib

# Deactivate environment
conda deactivate
```

### Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Code Editors

#### Popular Python IDEs:
- **PyCharm**: Professional IDE with comprehensive features (Community edition is free)
- **Spyder**: Scientific development environment, included with Anaconda
- **VSCode**: Lightweight editor with excellent Python support via extensions
- **Jupyter Notebook/Lab**: Browser-based, interactive environment for data science
- **IDLE**: Basic IDE included with Python installation

#### Setting up VSCode for Python:
1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Install the Python extension
3. Open a Python file and select your interpreter
4. Install the Pylance extension for enhanced features

### Hello World in Python

Create a file called `hello.py`:

```python
# This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")  # This prints a message

# Multiple print statements
print("Python is")
print("awesome!")

# Variables
name = "Python Programmer"
print("Hello, " + name)
```

Run the script:
```bash
python hello.py  # Or python3 hello.py on macOS/Linux
```

### Python Interactive Mode

Python has an interactive mode for experimenting with code:

```bash
# Start Python interactive mode
python  # or python3

# Now you can type Python commands directly
>>> print("Hello, interactive Python")
Hello, interactive Python
>>> 2 + 3
5
>>> exit()  # Exit interactive mode
```

### Practice Exercise: Environment Setup

1. Install Python and verify the installation
2. Set up a virtual environment for a new project
3. Install a package (e.g., `requests`) within the virtual environment
4. Create and run a simple "Hello World" script
5. Try Python's interactive mode to perform basic calculations

## Basic Syntax and Data Types

### Python Syntax Basics

Python uses indentation to define code blocks:

```python
# Function definition
def greet(name):
    # This is indented with 4 spaces
    print("Hello, " + name)
    
    # Another indented block
    if name == "Python":
        print("Nice name!")

# No indentation for the main code
greet("Python")
```

Key syntax elements:
- Lines end without semicolons
- Blocks use indentation (usually 4 spaces)
- Comments start with `#`
- Statements typically occupy one line

### Variables

Python variables don't need explicit type declarations:

```python
# Variable assignment
name = "John"  # String
age = 30       # Integer
height = 1.85  # Float
is_student = True  # Boolean

# Multiple assignment
a, b, c = 1, 2, 3

# Checking the type
print(type(name))  # <class 'str'>
print(type(age))   # <class 'int'>
```

Naming conventions:
- Use lowercase with underscores for variables: `first_name`
- Constants are typically in all uppercase: `MAX_SIZE`
- Class names use CamelCase: `MyClass`
- Start with a letter or underscore, followed by letters, digits, or underscores
- Case-sensitive: `value` and `Value` are different variables

### Data Types

#### Numeric Types

```python
# Integer
x = 42
big_number = 1_000_000  # Underscores for readability

# Float
pi = 3.14159
scientific = 1.23e-4  # Scientific notation

# Complex
complex_num = 2 + 3j

# Operations
addition = 5 + 3
subtraction = 10 - 4
multiplication = 6 * 7
division = 15 / 4       # Returns float: 3.75
floor_division = 15 // 4  # Returns integer: 3
modulo = 15 % 4         # Remainder: 3
exponentiation = 2 ** 3  # 2Â³ = 8

# Type conversion
int_value = int(3.9)  # 3
float_value = float(5)  # 5.0
```

#### String Type

```python
# String creation
single_quotes = 'Hello'
double_quotes = "World"
triple_quotes = '''This is a
multi-line string'''

# String operations
combined = single_quotes + " " + double_quotes  # "Hello World"
repeated = "Ha" * 3  # "HaHaHa"

# String indexing (0-based)
word = "Python"
first_char = word[0]  # 'P'
last_char = word[-1]  # 'n'

# String slicing
substring = word[1:4]  # 'yth'
from_start = word[:2]  # 'Py'
to_end = word[2:]      # 'thon'
reversed_string = word[::-1]  # 'nohtyP'

# String methods
upper_case = word.upper()       # 'PYTHON'
lower_case = word.lower()       # 'python'
replaced = word.replace('P', 'J')  # 'Jython'
split_string = "a,b,c".split(',')  # ['a', 'b', 'c']
joined = '-'.join(['a', 'b', 'c'])  # 'a-b-c'
stripped = "  spaces  ".strip()     # 'spaces'

# String formatting
name = "Alice"
age = 30

# Old-style formatting
message1 = "Name: %s, Age: %d" % (name, age)

# str.format() method
message2 = "Name: {}, Age: {}".format(name, age)
message3 = "Name: {n}, Age: {a}".format(n=name, a=age)

# f-strings (Python 3.6+)
message4 = f"Name: {name}, Age: {age}"
calculation = f"2 + 2 = {2 + 2}"

# Raw strings (ignore escape characters)
raw_string = r"C:\new\folder"  # Backslashes are preserved
```

#### Boolean Type

```python
# Boolean values
is_valid = True
is_completed = False

# Boolean operations
and_result = True and False  # False
or_result = True or False    # True
not_result = not True        # False

# Comparison operators
equals = (5 == 5)          # True
not_equals = (5 != 3)      # True
greater_than = (5 > 3)     # True
less_than = (5 < 10)       # True
greater_or_equal = (5 >= 5)  # True
less_or_equal = (5 <= 6)     # True

# Truthiness
# These values evaluate to False:
falsy_values = [False, None, 0, "", [], {}, set()]

# Everything else is truthy
if "some_string":
    print("This will execute because non-empty strings are truthy")
```

#### None Type

```python
# None represents absence of value
value = None

# Checking for None
if value is None:
    print("Value is None")

# Common use case - default function parameters
def my_function(param=None):
    if param is None:
        param = []
    param.append(1)
    return param
```

### Collections

#### Lists

```python
# List creation
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
mixed = [1, "hello", True, 3.14]
nested = [1, [2, 3], 4]
empty = []

# Accessing elements
first_fruit = fruits[0]      # "apple"
nested_element = nested[1][0]  # 2

# Modifying lists
fruits[1] = "orange"  # Replace banana with orange
fruits.append("grape")  # Add to end
fruits.insert(1, "mango")  # Insert at index 1
popped = fruits.pop()  # Remove and return last item
fruits.remove("apple")  # Remove specific item
del fruits[0]  # Delete by index

# List operations
combined = fruits + ["kiwi", "melon"]  # Concatenation
repeated = ["x"] * 3  # ["x", "x", "x"]
length = len(fruits)  # Number of items

# List slicing (similar to strings)
first_two = fruits[:2]
last_two = fruits[-2:]

# List methods
fruits.sort()  # Sort in-place
fruits.reverse()  # Reverse in-place
index = fruits.index("cherry")  # Find index of an item
count = fruits.count("apple")  # Count occurrences
fruits.extend(["fig", "date"])  # Add multiple items
fruits.clear()  # Remove all items

# List comprehensions
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]  # [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
even_squares = [x**2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]  # [0, 4, 16, 36, 64]
```

#### Tuples

```python
# Tuple creation (immutable ordered collection)
coordinates = (10, 20)
person = ("John", 30, "New York")
single_item = (42,)  # The comma is necessary for single-item tuples
empty_tuple = ()

# Accessing elements
x = coordinates[0]  # 10
y = coordinates[1]  # 20

# Tuple packing and unpacking
coordinates
