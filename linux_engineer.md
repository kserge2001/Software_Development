## üî∞ Absolute Beginners

This section is designed for people with no prior experience in IT or computing. It lays the groundwork for your journey to becoming a Linux engineer.

## Introduction to Computing

### What is a Computer?

At its most basic level, a computer is a machine that can:
- Accept inputs (keyboard, mouse, touchscreen, etc.)
- Process data according to instructions (programs)
- Store data (RAM for temporary storage, drives for permanent storage)
- Provide outputs (display, print, sound, etc.)

### Computer Hardware Basics

#### Essential Components:
- **CPU (Central Processing Unit)**: The "brain" of the computer that executes instructions
- **Memory (RAM)**: Temporary storage used while the computer is running
- **Storage Devices**: Hard drives (HDD), Solid State Drives (SSD) for permanent storage
- **Motherboard**: The main circuit board connecting all components
- **Power Supply**: Provides electrical power to components
- **Input/Output Devices**: Keyboard, mouse, monitor, etc.

### Software Fundamentals

Software is a collection of instructions that tells the hardware what to do:

- **System Software**: Programs that manage computer hardware and provide a platform for running applications
  - Operating Systems (Windows, macOS, Linux)
  - Device drivers
  - Utilities

- **Application Software**: Programs that perform specific tasks for users
  - Web browsers
  - Word processors
  - Games
  - Specialized tools

### Binary and Computer Logic

Computers use binary (0s and 1s) for all operations:

- Binary is a base-2 number system (only uses 0 and 1)
- Each binary digit (bit) can be represented by an electrical signal (on or off)
- 8 bits = 1 byte
- Computer operations are based on logical operations (AND, OR, NOT)

```
Example: The number 42 in binary
42 √∑ 2 = 21 remainder 0
21 √∑ 2 = 10 remainder 1
10 √∑ 2 = 5 remainder 0
5 √∑ 2 = 2 remainder 1
2 √∑ 2 = 1 remainder 0
1 √∑ 2 = 0 remainder 1
Reading from bottom up: 101010
```

## What are Operating Systems?

### Definition and Purpose

An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs:

- Acts as an intermediary between users and hardware
- Manages resources (CPU, memory, I/O devices)
- Provides an interface for users and applications
- Ensures security and stability

### Key Functions of Operating Systems

1. **Process Management**: Creates, schedules, and terminates processes
2. **Memory Management**: Allocates and deallocates memory
3. **File System Management**: Organizes and maintains files and directories
4. **Device Management**: Controls input/output devices
5. **Security**: Controls access to resources and data
6. **User Interface**: Provides ways for users to interact with the computer

### Types of Operating Systems

- **Windows**: Microsoft's proprietary OS (Windows 10, Windows 11, Windows Server)
- **macOS**: Apple's proprietary OS for Mac computers
- **Linux**: Open-source, Unix-like operating system
- **Unix**: Original multi-user, multitasking operating system
- **Mobile OS**: Android (Linux-based), iOS (Unix-based)
- **Embedded OS**: For specialized devices (IoT, appliances)

### Operating System Components

- **Kernel**: Core component that manages system resources
- **Shell**: Interface that accepts user commands
- **File System**: Organizes and stores files
- **Device Drivers**: Software that communicates with hardware
- **System Utilities**: Tools for system maintenance and configuration

## Introduction to Linux

### What is Linux?

Linux is an open-source, Unix-like operating system kernel created by Linus Torvalds in 1991. When people refer to "Linux," they typically mean a complete operating system built around the Linux kernel, which includes many utilities and applications.

### History of Linux

- **1969**: UNIX was developed at Bell Labs by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie
- **1983**: Richard Stallman started the GNU Project to create a free Unix-like OS
- **1991**: Linus Torvalds created the Linux kernel
- **1992-Present**: Ongoing development by thousands of contributors worldwide

### Linux vs. Other Operating Systems

| Feature | Linux | Windows | macOS |
|---------|-------|---------|-------|
| **License** | Open-source | Proprietary | Proprietary |
| **Cost** | Mostly free | Paid | Comes with Apple hardware |
| **Customization** | Highly customizable | Limited | Limited |
| **Security** | Generally very secure | Vulnerable to malware | Generally secure |
| **User Interface** | Multiple options (GNOME, KDE, etc.) | Windows Explorer | macOS interface |
| **Software Installation** | Package managers | Installers/Store | App Store/Installers |
| **Market Share** | Dominates servers, low on desktop | Dominates desktop | Mid-range desktop share |
| **Updates** | User-controlled | Semi-forced | Semi-forced |

### Linux Distributions (Distros)

A Linux distribution is an operating system built on the Linux kernel, packaged with additional software:

#### Popular Distributions:

- **Debian-based**:
  - Ubuntu: User-friendly, great for beginners
  - Debian: Stable, secure, foundation for many distros
  - Linux Mint: User-friendly, Windows-like interface

- **Red Hat-based**:
  - Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL): Enterprise-focused, paid support
  - CentOS/Rocky Linux/AlmaLinux: Free RHEL alternatives
  - Fedora: Cutting-edge, community version of Red Hat

- **Others**:
  - Arch Linux: Rolling release, highly customizable
  - SUSE/openSUSE: Enterprise and community versions
  - Gentoo: Source-based, highly optimizable

#### Choosing a Distribution

For beginners, these distributions are recommended:
- **Ubuntu**: Most beginner-friendly with extensive community support
- **Linux Mint**: Familiar interface for Windows users
- **Fedora**: If you want to learn skills applicable to Red Hat environments

For this guide, we'll primarily use **Ubuntu** for examples, but will note differences for Red Hat-based systems where relevant.

### The Linux Philosophy

Linux follows several key philosophies:

1. **Everything is a file**: Devices, processes, and system information are represented as files
2. **Small, single-purpose programs**: Programs should do one thing well
3. **Programs work together**: Chain simple programs to perform complex tasks
4. **Text configuration**: Most configuration is done via text files
5. **Open-source development**: Code is freely available and community-driven

### Linux in the Real World

Linux powers:
- **Over 90% of the world's top 500 supercomputers**
- **Most web servers** (Apache, Nginx run primarily on Linux)
- **Cloud infrastructure** (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure use Linux extensively)
- **Android devices** (Android is built on the Linux kernel)
- **Embedded systems** (routers, smart TVs, IoT devices)
- **Scientific and research computing**

### Exercise: Linux Exploration
